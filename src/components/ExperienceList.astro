                I also worked on fine tuning and deploying a Large Language Model (Alpaca 7B and 13B) on a custom dataset. I benchmarked the models 
                to enable easier decision making on which model to deploy to production.`}

        body={`Worked as an MLOps Engineer where I built 
                efficient data engineering pipelines using DBT to transform raw data from Snowflake into clean data. 
                The pipelines were designed to follow best data engineering practices with observability, 
                reproducibility, testing, and version control. I also built data engineering pipelines to move 
                clean data from Snowflake to a production database that could be used by the model APIs (MongoDB). 
                The pipelines were built to be platform agnostic and could move data from any source to any destination.
                
                I built infrastructure using AWS Sagemaker to streamline the model deployment process to production, 
                where each model was thoroughly checked against an unseen test dataset and all metrics were saved 
                to the MLflow model registry for review. I successfully deployed multiple models on APIs using Docker, 
                FastAPI, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Elastic Beanstalk, and Terraform. I set up a monitoring server using 
                Grafana to track internal infrastructure performance, data pipeline execution, and data distribution in production.
