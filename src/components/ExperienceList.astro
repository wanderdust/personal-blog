                body={`Worked as an MLOps Engineer where I built 
                efficient data engineering pipelines using DBT to transform raw data from Snowflake into clean data. 
                The pipelines were designed to follow best data engineering practices with observability, 
                reproducibility, testing, and version control. I also built data engineering pipelines to move 
                clean data from Snowflake to a production database that could be used by the model APIs (MongoDB). 
                The pipelines were built to be platform agnostic and could move data from any source to any destination.
                
                I built infrastructure using AWS Sagemaker to streamline the model deployment process to production, 
                where each model was thoroughly checked against an unseen test dataset and all metrics were saved 
                to the MLflow model registry for review. I successfully deployed multiple models on APIs using Docker, 
                FastAPI, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Elastic Beanstalk, and Terraform. I set up a monitoring server using 
                Grafana to track internal infrastructure performance, data pipeline execution, and data distribution in production.

                imagery using PyTorch, PyTorch lightning, Python, and Docker. I also set up infrastructure to track 
                Machine Learning experiments using MLflow.

                I deployed the deep learning models to AWS batch to run offline predictions, and all model repositories 
                were deployed using CI/CD with Terraform and AWS CodePipeline. Additionally, I built front-end applications 
                using React and Dash to showcase the models to non-technical stakeholders in an engaging and interactive way.
                    
                My experience in Agile methodologies including Kanban and SCRUM allowed me to conduct multiple tech 
                Retrospectives and tech Stand-ups, making the overall development process more efficient and 
                streamlined. Working as a Machine Learning Engineer has allowed me to utilize my skills and 
                knowledge to build efficient models and streamline the deployment process.
