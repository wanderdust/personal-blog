I'm excited to share that I've recently built a "buy me a coffee" app using the Ethereum Blockchain! This project has been a great opportunity for me to learn more about web3 and the current state of blockchain technology.

One of the key things I've learned is the role that wallets play in interacting with smart contracts on the blockchain. A smart contract looks essentially like Java Class with its functions and properties where you can define the conditions of an agreement using code and execute it when those conditions are met. This code is deployed to the blockchain, where it can be accessed and executed via an API.

One of the cool things about smart contracts is that they can be used to permanently store data, such as a record of transactions. They can also facilitate the exchange of tokens, which opens up a world of possibilities for applications and services that rely on secure, transparent and verifiable transactions.

Another aspect of blockchain technology that I find really interesting is the potential for using a wallet as a single way of proving your identity across different apps and websites. This could greatly simplify the process of managing multiple logins and passwords, making it easier for users to securely access the services they need.

In terms of the technical details, I used hardhat to deploy the smart contract and next.js + tailwind to build the app that interacts with it. You can check out the app at [https://buymeacoffee-dapp.netlify.app/](https://buymeacoffee-dapp.netlify.app/), but note that you will need a metamask wallet and test ethereum to use it.

Overall, I'm really pleased with how this project has turned out and I'm excited to continue learning about the potential of blockchain technology.
