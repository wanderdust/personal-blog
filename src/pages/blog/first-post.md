Welcome to my new website! It has been a long time since I've played around with new front end frameworks, so I decided to rebuild my personal site. I have used Astro and Tailwind, and I only have good things to say about both frameworks. It only took me a couple hours to understand and start using Astro from a template, and a couple of days to build this site. It is an awesome choice for static websites like this. On the other hand Tailwind really simplifies the page styiling by prividing predefined classes that are ready to go. It is such a good framework for the occasional front end developer like me. Please forgive the minimalistic styles of the website, there is still so much css I can endure with Tailwind or not.

I have also added a lovely blog section so I can write random thoughts no one will read! ðŸš€
